<h4>My name is Lia Massari, and I am a professional tattoo artist based in Northwest Ohio, specializing in fine line and black-and-grey work. I currently work at Grim Heart Tattoo in the vibrant Gordon Square neighborhood. My journey into tattooing began in 2021, when I took a leap of faith to pursue my passion, transitioning from a career in the service industry to one in art. This decision followed years of personal involvement in art, where I always sought to make creativity a central focus of my life.</h4>
<br>
<h4>Throughout my apprenticeship, I was fortunate to receive mentorship that emphasized the importance of traditional tattooing fundamentals and the rich history behind the craft. While I specialize in fine line work, my respect for traditional tattoo imagery remains strong, and I continue to enjoy incorporating elements of this style into my pieces. I also have a growing interest in adding portraiture to my portfolio and look forward to expanding this area of my work.</h4>

<h4>Beyond tattooing, I maintain a strong connection to my local music scene, which has been a significant part of my life for many years. Whether attending shows, booking bands, or creating promotional material like flyers, my involvement in music remains a driving force in my creative endeavors. Tattooing has been a truly fulfilling extension of this passion, allowing me to channel my artistic energy into a career that brings me immense satisfaction.</h4>

<h4>I am grateful for the opportunity to share my art with others and continue growing in this dynamic and rewarding field.</h4>
